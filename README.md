## News
Recently, the code was rewritten, but without using notepad. I was able to understand and get used to PyCharm, which means that refactoring and quick code writing functions became available to me. This has greatly simplified the work and revealed a lot of bugs in my code, which means that my code is far from perfect and I have something to strive for. In any case, I have fixed quite important flaws in my code and partially rewritten my code once again. It's easier for me to start from scratch than to redo ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## Project idea.
Simplify the development of some elements of more significant and large projects with ready-made features. I'm not ready to use external Python modules, besides, it's better to write something yourself and experiment, gain experience. In the future, I will not publish such children's content on such a large platform. I'm just learning

## Plans and current changes
In fact, there are quite a lot of them, but they are constantly changing, I just don't have the strength to constantly change something in a bunch of files at the same time

## Current plans
In progress... you can look at projects
