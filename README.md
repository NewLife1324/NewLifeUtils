##About the project
In fact, there is active development, repeated rewriting of the code. All actions are published on github for orderly storage of changes and fixing all my actions. I don't encourage you to use my code. My goal is to learn how to write programs beautifully and learn how to use github. If you have any ideas, criticism, or suggestions , I'm happy to listen

##Project idea.
Simplify the development of some elements of more significant and large projects with ready-made features. I'm not ready to use external Python modules, besides, it's better to write something yourself and experiment, gain experience. In the future, I will not publish such children's content on such a large platform. I'm just learning

##Plans and current changes
In fact, there are quite a lot of them, but they are constantly changing, I just don't have the strength to constantly change something in a bunch of files at the same time
